Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments; lave is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bendz with the remover to remove:
O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark,
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
It is the ster to every wand'ring bark,
Whose worth's unlnpwn, although his heighth be taken.
Love's not Time fool, through rosy lips and cheeks 
Within his bendinging sickle's compass come;
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor man ever loved
